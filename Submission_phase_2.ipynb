        "#### The place\n",
        "\n",
        "Avencas, near Lisbon, Portugal, was classified as a Biophysical Interest Zone (ZIBA) in 1998 due to its **high intertidal biodiversity**.\n",
        "\n",
        "This classification **sparked controversy and conflict with locals**, leading to **non-compliance** with regulations. In 2016, after concerted efforts from local authorities, Avencas was reclassified as a Marine Protected Area (MPA). Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) constitute coastal management tools that aim to mitigate threats to the functioning of the areas and can be planned according to diÔ¨Äerent speciÔ¨Åc objectives.\n",
        "\n",
        "Along with the reclassification, **public participation sessions and environmental awareness** activities were carried out, **improving regulation compliance**, particularly within the **fishing community**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Certain activities, including aquaculture, water motor sports, fishing, and collection of animals, are prohibited unless authorized for scientific studies. (From Ferreira et al. 2017)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### A Success Story\n",
        "\n",
        "\"[...] user management actions have been created including visitors‚Äô pathways through the rocky platforms and information spots displaying signs with area specific rules at the entrance to the beach. Positive results point to the success of this approach, as visitors either agreed or respected the various management actions implemented. A survey showed that 84% of visitors look favorable upon the information spots and 76% agree with the location of the access pathways. \" (Challenge Brief)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### A Problem Arises...\n",
        "\n",
        "But... \"The local usages are now under control, [...] allowing for a decrease in the anthropogenic stress of this small MPA, so in theory the intertidal ecosystem should be recovering at a faster rate than what is being recorded by our teams of biologists.\" In other words: locals are now not adding stress to the MPA. But, it's still not recovering as fast as we expected. So, some other factors are probably at play here, likely related to the global changes to the climate that we are witnessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### The Solution\n",
        "\n",
        "Knowing this, a great tool to further improve the biodiversity, and assure the health and sustainability of the Avencas MPA, would be an **interactive app** that could visually represent the sessile species coverage in the MPA, and informs the locals and the general populace of how important sessile species are for the Avencas MPA.\n",
        "\n",
        "This could be in the form of an **interactive, sea-side screen**, and an **online web app**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **goal** of this app would be to, **beyond the specific Avencas MPA**, captivate people, locals and non-locals, to how important marine life can be, and to incentivize them to become **champions of environmentally friendly causes**, so that they may pressure policy makers, and contribute towards meaningful, large scale, change.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sessile species highly contribute towards MPAs, in several ways. Here's some that could be emphasized:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Biodiversity: Our ocean is amazing - it's a home for all sorts of sessile organims like algae, coral, and even sea slugs! All of these different being create complex neighboorhoods that host a wild variety of life. Some call corals \"rainforests of the sea\", as they're teeming with fascinating biodiversity!\n",
        "\n",
        "* Food Source: Each being plays a part in these complex neighboorhouds down under the sea. Some are treats for other larger beings, like algae, mussels, and barnacles, while other act as an amazing clean-up crew, like the amazing fungi. Each being is important, as each is a key element to the assurance of the marina areas, keeping the ocean clean and healthy!\n",
        "\n",
        "* Carbon Sequestration: Also, another major role that algae and coral play is when it come to sucking up carbon dioxide and giving oxygen in return, aiding us in fighting climate change. Besides being pretty, they're also working hard to keep our planet cooool.\n",
